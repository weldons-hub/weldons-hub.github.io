        <p>Hi,my name is Mae and I am Frankies older sister.</p>
        <p>I do street dance and love to experiment with makeup and spend time with my friends.</p> <p>Recently I started a youtube channel to keep myself entertained! Here is a link to my channel</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBab2elSk0-F7zuhKGS4vKQ/">CLICK ON THIS !!!</a> </p>
        <p>Along-side makeup and shopping I love to read thriller and horror books!</p>
        <p>These are my favorite because I love to understand what the character is feeling and I am often interested in the motives </p>
        <p> the "bad guy" as they are often more exiting and understandable than the hero.These are my favourite. I would reccomend these for 12-15 year olds</p>
